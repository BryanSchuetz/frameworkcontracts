      <title>AWP 2 Projects Review</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/awp-2-projects-review</link>

      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/awp-2-projects-review</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beyond WTO Program (B-WTO) was developed in response to a request from the Government of Vietnam (GoV) for donor support to help with managing economic integration and the transition to a market economy following WTO accession. The B-WTO goal is “to strengthen government’s capacity to manage the integration of Vietnam into the global economy and the transition of Vietnam to a socialist market economy”. The immediate objective is “implementation of priority policy actions from the GoV’s Action Plan to enhance Vietnam’s capacity to sustain pro-poor growth (GAP)”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remit of this project was a review of the 2nd annual work plan’s implementation (AWP2) of Phase 2 of the B-WTO in May 2013. The objectives of the review were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the project implementation performance and project results relative to the logical framework targets and evaluation criteria. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the results achieved at the Component and Program’s level according to the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) framework of the Program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify lessons learned from implementation, make recommendations for the remaining duration of the program and the Independent Completion Report process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Health Program M&amp;E</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/health-program-me</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Australian Government is scoping and piloting a new approach to engagement in the health sector in Timor-Leste. The program approach is innovative in several respects. Key program features are: a systems perspective; joint program oversight by MoH and Australian Government; an emphasis on capacity facilitation through coaching rather than an over-reliance on more traditional technical assistance approaches; ongoing processes of joint intervention design throughout implementation; and rapid cycles of evidence-informed adaptation. These will require significant investments in interactive, exploratory, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation, requiring support from an M&amp;amp;E Specialist that is comfortable with non-traditional M&amp;amp;E approaches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Program M&amp;amp;E Specialist worked with the Australian Government Timor-Leste Health Team to design an M&amp;amp;E system for Australia’s support to the health sector, that is aligned with the Ministry of Health’s draft Sector M&amp;amp;E Framework and consistent with Australian Aid Program M&amp;amp;E Standards. The primary purpose of the M&amp;amp;E System will be to support strategic management and ongoing improvement of the Australian Government - MoH partnership in the health sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Program 2013 Performance and Quality Mapping Exercise</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/program-2013-performance-and-quality-mapping-exercise</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AusAID’s PNG Program is looking to improve its performance and quality (P&amp;amp;Q) standards and systems. The purpose of this project was to map the PNG Program’s current P&amp;amp;Q capacity and systems, to address the risk of AusAID being unable to demonstrate results for its increased investments in PNG over the next four years. Over the last several years, the PNG Program has undertaken a number of M&amp;amp;E assessments and reviews which have identified key strengths and challenges within the program. This project was intended to pick up where these assessments left off. Through a desk review and consultations with sector teams, the Review Team were to distil key P&amp;amp;Q risks and issues for the PNG Program. The Review Team’s brief included the provision of recommendations on priority activities to support sector approaches to M&amp;amp;E, strengthen the Program’s ability to collect evidence, provide critical analysis and report on results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Humanitarian Performance Assessment Framework</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/humanitarian-performance-assessment-framework</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AusAID required a consultant to assist with the development and finalisation of its Humanitarian Performance Assessment Framework. Development of a humanitarian monitoring and evaluation framework is a key commitment outlined in AusAID’s 2011 Humanitarian Action Policy (HAP) and its associated Implementation Plan. In line with the agency focus on results reporting, the HAP and HAP Implementation Plan commit AusAID to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to support the initial performance assessment framework contained within the HAP and AusAID annual reporting under the Comprehensive Aid Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key objective of this assignment was to build the Humanitarian program’s capacity for monitoring and reporting results by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In consultation with AusAID’s Humanitarian team, redraft and finalise the Humanitarian Performance Assessment Framework, to ensure it provides a platform to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track implementation of key commitments in Australia’s 2011 Humanitarian Action Policy; and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a set of measurable humanitarian performance indicators (in addition to the two CAPF indicators) to enable AusAID to track achievements, lessons learned and to report on the results achieved from AusAID’s humanitarian work.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the assignment was to examine country views of aid effectiveness and regional organisations expressed through Forum Compact reporting, particularly peer review of Forum Island Countries’ national development plan processes. The services provided included the preparation of a think piece which outlines key aid effectiveness issues arising from country reporting under the Compact reporting and discusses options for addressing these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Study on Community-based Social Protection</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/study-on-community-based-social-protection</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 16:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Bryan Schuetz</author>
      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/study-on-community-based-social-protection</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poverty and Social Analysis is the process of using and generating evidence on poverty throughout the aid management cycle. Most poverty and social analysis focuses on economic and human capital, but there are two oft neglected elements: voice and influence, and social capital. Yet more and more development practitioners are recognizing the importance of social capital, particularly informal social capital, in preventing and addressing poverty and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project supported AusAID to explore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the role of informal social capital in the Fijian context and whether it lends itself to fair redistribution of resources and, if so, the ways in which AusAID can engage with local communities to strengthen existing social capital structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how such structures can enable the disempowered and poor to claim their entitlements in the three domains discussed in the PSA framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the potential challenges that can arise from such efforts. For instance, the poorest are often included on less favorable terms within social networks, and have access to fewer and lower-quality networks. Further, we need to better understand how poverty and disempowerment intersect with an absence of informal social capital, the repercussions this has, and the options available for tackling this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/provision-of-a-child-protection-specialist</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this project HTSPE was contracted to provide a child protection specialist and handle all the associated management and administrative work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child protection specialist provided by HTSPE was required to work on an assignment designed to assist the Pacific Division (PACD) to improve its approach to child protection and managing risks to children. AusAID has a number of partners in the Pacific who work with children or come into contact with children through their activities. The AusAID-wide child protection stocktake, conducted in May 2013 found that there are a number of organisations funded by AusAID in the Pacific with a high or very high inherent child protection risk. Consistent with the stocktake report PACD proposes to escalate efforts to ensure partner organisations policies, procedures and practices are in accordance with AusAID’s Child Protection Policy 2013 and to make child protection a more explicit focus of PACD’s risk management system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Extractives for Growth (E4G) will be one of three key components. Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4G will focus on &lt;strong&gt;three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique)&lt;/strong&gt; where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – M&amp;amp;E Specialist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree in associated discipline will provide a considerable advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minimum of 5 years in Monitoring and Evaluation, preferably in the field of extractives and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 5 years of experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in the extractives and natural resources fields is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is also desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Extractives for Growth (E4G) will be one of three key components. Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4G will focus on &lt;strong&gt;three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique)&lt;/strong&gt; where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – Team Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree in natural resources or an associated discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some experience working in the field of extractives and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 years of previous experience as a Team Leader &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.  Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships offered by the Australian Government to the next generation of global leaders. Australia Awards provide opportunities for long-term (Masters) and short course study and professional development, aiming to develop capacity and leadership skills so that individuals can contribute to development in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia Awards will be comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Scholarships: demand-driven Masters undertaken at Australian universities, to be offered to approximately 11 Sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Africa Short Courses: tailored short (two-three months) post-graduate courses in sectors where Australia has recognised expertise and which are areas of priority to partner governments (agriculture, extractives and public policy). Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Award Fellowships: short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment in Australia, delivered by Australian organisations. Currently available across Africa to nominated fellows from eligible countries (this will be delivered through a global program external to the AADP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards – Alumni Engagement Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary degree in a relevant discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent project management skills &lt;/li&gt;

      <title>M&amp;E Adviser, Labour Mobility Initiative</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/me-adviser-labour-mobility-initiative</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2014 20:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Penny  Buckle</author>
      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/me-adviser-labour-mobility-initiative</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2009 Australia has funded Pacific island governments under the Labour Mobility Initiative (LMI) to recruit, prepare and manage workers for job placements in the Pilot Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) and then the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2013, a design mission was undertaken to develop a new phase of the LMI with a focus on improving the capacity of participating governments to recruit, prepare and manage workers for the SWP and to assess new options for capacity development and delivery. Any capacity building assistance would continue to focus on Pacific island governments as managers of the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new LMI aims to improve the capacity of participating governments to manage aspects of the SWP. There are nine participating countries in the SWP – Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga and Timor-Leste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the LMI is to address poverty through increasing incomes, improving human capital and maximising the use of earnings from labour mobility for women and men in the region. At the conclusion of the LMI, there are expected to be four primary outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased numbers of workers from participating countries take up seasonal work opportunities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities benefiting from the effective use of remittances earned through labour mobility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women and men participating in the seasonal worker program have increased employability &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased partner government capacity to manage international labour &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;M&amp;amp;E Adviser&lt;/strong&gt; will have overall responsibility for effective monitoring and evaluation of the LMI, as well as delivering capacity building and training to staff of partner governments responsible for M&amp;amp;E of labour mobility programs. These services will be delivered to best-practice standards, in accordance with the requirements and terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience working in developing countries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven capacity to build and maintain effective relationships with senior personnel in government and donor agencies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive knowledge of contemporary monitoring, evaluation, learning and reporting policies, and the development of M&amp;amp;E systems and frameworks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to transfer knowledge and understanding associated with M&amp;amp;E systems and procedures to developing country counterparts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of the social, cultural, political and institutional factors affecting development in the Pacific and Timor-Leste. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills, strong interpersonal, oral and written communication skills in English. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirable&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary qualification in a relevant field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the design and delivery of M&amp;amp;E systems for capacity building programs in the Pacific and Timor-Leste. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Australian aid program processes and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;M&amp;amp;E Adviser&lt;/strong&gt; may have up to 240 days of inputs across the total Program (both the initial term and Option to Extend term, in the event that the Option to Extend was enacted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you meet the criteria and would like to be considered for this nominated role please email your CV with a covering note outlining how you fit the requirements. Please email your application to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sarah_owen@dai.com&quot;&gt;sarah_owen@dai.com&lt;/a&gt;  quoting &lt;strong&gt;LMI/M&amp;amp;E&lt;/strong&gt;  in the subject line of your email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only shortlisted candidates will be contacted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the LMI is to address poverty through increasing incomes, improving human capital and maximising the use of earnings from labour mobility for women and men in the region. At the conclusion of the LMI, there are expected to be four primary outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased numbers of workers from participating countries take up seasonal work opportunities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities benefiting from the effective use of remittances earned through labour mobility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women and men participating in the seasonal worker program have increased employability &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased partner government capacity to manage international labour &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Capacity Building Adviser&lt;/strong&gt; will have responsibility for designing and supporting a program of capacity building assistance to participating government agencies and other stakeholders, ensuring all services are delivered to best-practice standards, in accordance with the requirements and terms of the contract, and for managing the day-to-day activities of other technical advisers as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience working in developing countries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven capacity to build and maintain effective relationships with senior personnel in government and donor agencies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive knowledge of contemporary human resource development strategies, planning and implementation, and the conduct and analysis of training needs assessments/analysis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to design and deliver training courses, development of culturally relevant materials and evaluate the effectiveness of training and capacity building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver a suite of development activities in a developing country. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of the social, cultural, political and institutional factors affecting development in the Pacific and Timor-Leste &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills, strong interpersonal, oral and written communication skills in English. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirable&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary qualification in a relevant field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the education, training and human development sectors in the Pacific region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Capacity Building Adviser&lt;/strong&gt; may have up to &lt;strong&gt;34 months&lt;/strong&gt; of inputs over the years of the LMI, with the first 28 months being full time from the Services Order start date, with 6 months allocated across the final 12 months (in the event that the Option to Extend was enacted).&lt;/p&gt;
