      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2009 Australia has funded Pacific island governments under the Labour Mobility Initiative (LMI) to recruit, prepare and manage workers for job placements in the Pilot Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) and then the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2013, a design mission was undertaken to develop a new phase of the LMI with a focus on improving the capacity of participating governments to recruit, prepare and manage workers for the SWP and to assess new options for capacity development and delivery. Any capacity building assistance would continue to focus on Pacific island governments as managers of the recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new LMI aims to improve the capacity of participating governments to manage aspects of the SWP. There are nine participating countries in the SWP – Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga and Timor-Leste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the LMI is to address poverty through increasing incomes, improving human capital and maximising the use of earnings from labour mobility for women and men in the region. At the conclusion of the LMI, there are expected to be four primary outcomes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased numbers of workers from participating countries take up seasonal work opportunities &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities benefiting from the effective use of remittances earned through labour mobility &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women and men participating in the seasonal worker program have increased employability &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased partner government capacity to manage international labour &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Team Leader&lt;/strong&gt; will have overall responsibility for ensuring all aspects of the Labour Mobility Initiative are delivered to best-practice standards, in accordance with the requirements and terms of the contract, and for managing the day-to-day activities of other program staff and technical advisers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive experience working in developing countries. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven capacity to build and maintain effective relationships with senior personnel in government and donor agencies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong understanding of labour mobility, seasonal work and labour hire practices, as well as related policy and regulatory frameworks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive knowledge of marketing approaches, developing marketing and engagement plans, building employer relationships and understanding of the requirements of Australian employers under the Seasonal Work Program. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to set up and manage a suite of development activities in a developing country. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantial experience in the application of financial management, contracting, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation systems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding of the social, cultural, political and institutional factors affecting development in the Pacific region and Timor-Leste. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills, strong interpersonal, oral and written communication skills in English. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirable&lt;/strong&gt; competencies and experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary qualification in a relevant field. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in the labour hire industry or policy environment, especially in relation to the sectors associated with seasonal work in Australia. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with Australian aid program processes and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Team leader may have up to 34 months of inputs over the years of the LMI, with the first 28 months being full time from the Services Order start date, with 6 months allocated across the final 12 months (in the event that the Option to Extend was enacted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you meet the criteria and would like to be considered for this nominated role please email your CV format with a covering note outlining how you fit the requirements. Please email your application to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:sarah_owen@dai.com&quot;&gt;sarah_owen@dai.com&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;LMI/TL&lt;/strong&gt; in the subject line of your email.&lt;/p&gt;
