&lt;li&gt;Experience with tracking the impacts of public-private partnerships (attribution of results, cost-sharing, etc); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in participatory design (outcome mapping, after action review, structured interviews, focus groups, case studies, surveys, and secondary data analysis techniques); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent command of survey design, data collection and data management, and data analysis using rigorous statistics and appropriate software; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with innovative handheld and online data collection systems; and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with economic development programs and gender mainstreaming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to explain M&amp;amp;E processes to staff and partners and ensure that they adhere to the highest standards of quality, relevance and timeliness in their M&amp;amp;E efforts; &lt;/li&gt;
