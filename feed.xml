      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/extractives-for-growth-program-e4g-team-leader</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 17:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Penny  Buckle</author>
      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/extractives-for-growth-program-e4g-team-leader</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives of the role&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Extractives for Growth (E4G) will be one of three key components. Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E4G&lt;/strong&gt; will focus on three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique) where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – Team Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree in natural resources or an associated discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some experience working in the field of extractives and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 years of previous experience as a Team Leader &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send your CV to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:brian_green@dai.com&quot;&gt;brian_green@dai.com&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the high number of applicants, if you have not been contacted by the application closing date then please assume your application has been unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please note that all profiles are indicative only and therefore subject to change once the ToR is made available.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E4G&lt;/strong&gt; will focus on three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique) where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – Operations Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent project management skills &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in the extractives and natural resources fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Award Fellowships: short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment in Australia, delivered by Australian organisations. Currently available across Africa to nominated fellows from eligible countries (this will be delivered through a global program external to the AADP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary degree in a relevant discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders
8 Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 years of previous experience as a Team Leader on development programs&lt;/li&gt;
