      <title>Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – Team Leader</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/extractives-for-growth-program-e4g-team-leader</link>

      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/extractives-for-growth-program-e4g-team-leader</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives of the role&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Extractives for Growth (E4G) will be one of three key components. Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E4G&lt;/strong&gt; will focus on three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique) where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – Team Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree in natural resources or an associated discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some experience working in the field of extractives and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 years of previous experience as a Team Leader &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send your CV to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:brian_green@dai.com&quot;&gt;brian_green@dai.com&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the high number of applicants, if you have not been contacted by the application closing date then please assume your application has been unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Australia Awards – Team Leader</title>

      <guid>http://frameworkcontracts.com/current-opportunities/australia-awards-team-leader</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives of the role:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.  Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships offered by the Australian Government to the next generation of global leaders. Australia Awards provide opportunities for long-term (Masters) and short course study and professional development, aiming to develop capacity and leadership skills so that individuals can contribute to development in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Scholarships: demand-driven Masters undertaken at Australian universities, to be offered to approximately 11 Sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Africa Short Courses: tailored short (two-three months) post-graduate courses in sectors where Australia has recognised expertise and which are areas of priority to partner governments (agriculture, extractives and public policy). Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives of the role&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.  Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships offered by the Australian Government to the next generation of global leaders. Australia Awards provide opportunities for long-term (Masters) and short course study and professional development, aiming to develop capacity and leadership skills so that individuals can contribute to development in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Scholarships: demand-driven Masters undertaken at Australian universities, to be offered to approximately 11 Sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Africa Short Courses: tailored short (two-three months) post-graduate courses in sectors where Australia has recognised expertise and which are areas of priority to partner governments (agriculture, extractives and public policy). Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Award Fellowships: short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment in Australia, delivered by Australian organisations. Currently available across Africa to nominated fellows from eligible countries (this will be delivered through a global program external to the AADP).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards – Operations Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary degree in an associated discipline &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWP 2 Projects Review</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/awp-2-projects-review</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Beyond WTO Program (B-WTO) was developed in response to a request from the Government of Vietnam (GoV) for donor support to help with managing economic integration and the transition to a market economy following WTO accession. The B-WTO goal is “to strengthen government’s capacity to manage the integration of Vietnam into the global economy and the transition of Vietnam to a socialist market economy”. The immediate objective is “implementation of priority policy actions from the GoV’s Action Plan to enhance Vietnam’s capacity to sustain pro-poor growth (GAP)”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remit of this project was a review of the 2nd annual work plan’s implementation (AWP2) of Phase 2 of the B-WTO in May 2013. The objectives of the review were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the project implementation performance and project results relative to the logical framework targets and evaluation criteria. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluate the results achieved at the Component and Program’s level according to the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) framework of the Program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify lessons learned from implementation, make recommendations for the remaining duration of the program and the Independent Completion Report process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Health Program M&amp;E</title>
      <link>http://frameworkcontracts.com/lots/dfat/health-program-me</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH), the Australian Government is scoping and piloting a new approach to engagement in the health sector in Timor-Leste. The program approach is innovative in several respects. Key program features are: a systems perspective; joint program oversight by MoH and Australian Government; an emphasis on capacity facilitation through coaching rather than an over-reliance on more traditional technical assistance approaches; ongoing processes of joint intervention design throughout implementation; and rapid cycles of evidence-informed adaptation. These will require significant investments in interactive, exploratory, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation, requiring support from an M&amp;amp;E Specialist that is comfortable with non-traditional M&amp;amp;E approaches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Health Program M&amp;amp;E Specialist worked with the Australian Government Timor-Leste Health Team to design an M&amp;amp;E system for Australia’s support to the health sector, that is aligned with the Ministry of Health’s draft Sector M&amp;amp;E Framework and consistent with Australian Aid Program M&amp;amp;E Standards. The primary purpose of the M&amp;amp;E System will be to support strategic management and ongoing improvement of the Australian Government - MoH partnership in the health sector.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AusAID’s PNG Program is looking to improve its performance and quality (P&amp;amp;Q) standards and systems. The purpose of this project was to map the PNG Program’s current P&amp;amp;Q capacity and systems, to address the risk of AusAID being unable to demonstrate results for its increased investments in PNG over the next four years. Over the last several years, the PNG Program has undertaken a number of M&amp;amp;E assessments and reviews which have identified key strengths and challenges within the program. This project was intended to pick up where these assessments left off. Through a desk review and consultations with sector teams, the Review Team were to distil key P&amp;amp;Q risks and issues for the PNG Program. The Review Team’s brief included the provision of recommendations on priority activities to support sector approaches to M&amp;amp;E, strengthen the Program’s ability to collect evidence, provide critical analysis and report on results.&lt;/p&gt;
