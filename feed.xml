      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Extractives for Growth (E4G) will be one of three key components. Through E4G, Australia will focus its assistance in three areas where the greatest potential for generating shared value between governments, communities and industry exists: skills development; extractives and communities; and the enabling environment. These are areas that: represent major risks for the private sector; are key to governments leveraging maximum development value from their extractives resources; will determine the employment and livelihood benefits that flow to communities; and require (and provide opportunities for) partnerships between governments, industry and communities to find solutions. The new program will harness Australia’s extractives-related expertise (private sector, government, non-government organisation, research and training). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E4G will focus on &lt;strong&gt;three target countries (Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique)&lt;/strong&gt; where Australia can maximise development benefits, and where there is a commitment by the government and private sector to improve the social benefits and economic growth opportunities from a well-managed and transparent extractives sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, ‘enabling environment’ activities will be conducted in 8-10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are likely to include Madagascar, South Africa, Ethiopia, Ghana and Nigeria, with the remainder yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extractives for Growth Program (E4G) – M&amp;amp;E Specialist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree in associated discipline will provide a considerable advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minimum of 5 years in Monitoring and Evaluation, preferably in the field of extractives and natural resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 5 years of experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in the extractives and natural resources fields is desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is also desirable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please send your CV to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:brian_green@dai.com&quot;&gt;brian_green@dai.com&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the high number of applicants, if you have not been contacted by the application closing date then please assume your application has been unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.  Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships offered by the Australian Government to the next generation of global leaders. Australia Awards provide opportunities for long-term (Masters) and short course study and professional development, aiming to develop capacity and leadership skills so that individuals can contribute to development in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia Awards will be comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Scholarships: demand-driven Masters undertaken at Australian universities, to be offered to approximately 11 Sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Africa Short Courses: tailored short (two-three months) post-graduate courses in sectors where Australia has recognised expertise and which are areas of priority to partner governments (agriculture, extractives and public policy). Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Award Fellowships: short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment in Australia, delivered by Australian organisations. Currently available across Africa to nominated fellows from eligible countries (this will be delivered through a global program external to the AADP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards – Alumni Engagement Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary degree in a relevant discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent project management skills &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience of working on previous scholarships/exchange programs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Previous work with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) is desirable&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s (DFAT) consolidated Sub-Saharan African Aid program, Australia Awards will be one of three key components.  Australia Awards are prestigious international scholarships offered by the Australian Government to the next generation of global leaders. Australia Awards provide opportunities for long-term (Masters) and short course study and professional development, aiming to develop capacity and leadership skills so that individuals can contribute to development in their home country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarships have been a key part of Australia’s aid program to Africa since the 1960s, providing over 5,000 scholarships across the continent and are an important development and public diplomacy tool in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to building critical skills and knowledge, they foster an engaged and influential network of leaders, reformers and advocates driving development across the continent, contributing to Australian economic diplomacy objectives and promoting valuable links between Australia and African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia Awards will be comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Scholarships: demand-driven Masters undertaken at Australian universities, to be offered to approximately 11 Sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Awards Africa Short Courses: tailored short (two-three months) post-graduate courses in sectors where Australia has recognised expertise and which are areas of priority to partner governments (agriculture, extractives and public policy). Offered to approximately 22 Sub-Saharan African countries, short course awards will be delivered through Australian registered training organisations, in partnership with African institutions to promote relevance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Australia Award Fellowships: short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment in Australia, delivered by Australian organisations. Currently available across Africa to nominated fellows from eligible countries (this will be delivered through a global program external to the AADP).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia Awards – Team Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tertiary degree in a relevant discipline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven communication and negotiation skills and an ability to work in a variety of cultural settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluent in English. Proficiency in French and Portuguese will be considered an asset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication skills and an ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to deliver long-term development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Professional Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least 8 years of previous experience as a Team Leader on development programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proven experience of working with regional scholarship programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience working in Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AusAID required a consultant to assist with the development and finalisation of its Humanitarian Performance Assessment Framework. Development of a humanitarian monitoring and evaluation framework is a key commitment outlined in AusAID’s 2011 Humanitarian Action Policy (HAP) and its associated Implementation Plan. In line with the agency focus on results reporting, the HAP and HAP Implementation Plan commit AusAID to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to support the initial performance assessment framework contained within the HAP and AusAID annual reporting under the Comprehensive Aid Policy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key objective of this assignment was to build the Humanitarian program’s capacity for monitoring and reporting results by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In consultation with AusAID’s Humanitarian team, redraft and finalise the Humanitarian Performance Assessment Framework, to ensure it provides a platform to:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track implementation of key commitments in Australia’s 2011 Humanitarian Action Policy; and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a set of measurable humanitarian performance indicators (in addition to the two CAPF indicators) to enable AusAID to track achievements, lessons learned and to report on the results achieved from AusAID’s humanitarian work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
